  about:
    "For the past years, I dedicated part of my role to fostering a strong design team culture. I believe in the power of scaling design rituals and maintaining a high-quality bar as the team expands. I believe in the value of collaborative problem-solving to drive innovative solutions and in transparent and honest communication to foster alignment and drive outcomes. I wish I could tell you I learned this the easy way.",
